A collection of interesting visuals made in Processing


Rainbow Sphere Skeleton has a slowly growing and shrinking sphere that shifts rainbows as it rotates. Every so often changes to a different vertex resolution.

Bezier Mandala uses 3 different colored beziers each with randomly generated colors and motion indeces repeated in a circle, causing warping mandala patterns that are always randomly different.

fineline Aliasing has a slowly pulsing color-fading shape that has parallel lines packed too close to display all of them. The result is odd curvature wiggles generated from the visual aliasing.
